## About

I'm lazy, and hate changing variables for each batch of screenshots I create. This script accepts an arbitrary number of video files and other options from the command line and generates screenshots using `ScreenGen` from the `awsmfunc` module. Screenshots are created with a frame info overlay including title, frame number, and picture type unless specified otherwise.

By default, screenshots are generated with character "tags", or letters, that distinguish them and make them easy to sort; for example, source screens will be named '1a.png', '2a.png', encode 1 screens will be '1b.png', '2b.png', etc. The script will check for existing tags and increment the characters so other screenshots in the same directory are not overwritten (unless you generate *a lot* of them, as there are only 26 characters in the English alphabet).

When capturing screenshots for multiple encodes, I highly recommend using the same crop values. When cropping the source, the first encode passed is used to get the dimensions. If you only want screenshots of the source and wish to crop it, use the `--crop` argument (see below).

## Dependencies

For installing dependencies on Windows, I *highly* recommend using the [VSRepo GUI](https://github.com/theChaosCoder/VSRepoGUI) so you don't have to hunt down all of the various GitHub repos and keep them updated. However, I list the various dependencies below if you wish to manage them manually.

### Python

The scripts have been tested against Python 3.13 alongside VapourSynth R72. Older VapourSynth releases still require a Python version that matches their respective installers, so ensure your Python runtime aligns with the VapourSynth build you are using.

### VapourSynth

Download the [VapourSynth](https://github.com/vapoursynth/vapoursynth/releases) installer and run it. Make sure you follow the instructions regarding the type of Python installation you have. I recommend doing a full install as I've had far less issues with it vs. the portable install. VapourSynth R72 or newer is recommended to pair with the Python 3.13 updates mentioned above.

### Python Packages

- [Vapoursynth](https://www.vapoursynth.com/)
- [Awsmfunc](https://github.com/OpusGang/awsmfunc)
  - [rekt](https://pypi.org/project/rekt/) (only required if you manually install dependencies)
  - This module includes support for several other optional plugins and scripts not included with this repo. See their docs for more details
- [opencv-contrib-python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-contrib-python/) (only required if you want to use the `compare.py` functionality)
  - Previewing clips before generating screenshots is accomplished via the [view](https://github.com/UniversalAl/view) module, which is not included in PyPI so I have added it to the repo under `modules`. This is the core dependency needed for this feature
- [argcomplete](https://kislyuk.github.io/argcomplete/#) (optional argument completer for Linux shells)

To make life easy, use the `requirements.txt` file included as it will install all of the additional dependencies needed by the packages above:

```python
# From the projects's root level directory
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### VapourSynth Plugins

- [vs-placebo](https://github.com/Lypheo/vs-placebo) (tonemapping only)
- [dovi](https://github.com/quietvoid/dovi_tool/tree/main/dolby_vision) (tonemapping only)

For loading clips, either `lsmas` or `ffms2` are required. `ffms2` is preferred as it supports DoVi tonemapping. The scripting allows you to specify which one you want to use:

- [lsmas](https://github.com/HomeOfAviSynthPlusEvolution/L-SMASH-Works)
- [ffms2](https://github.com/FFMS/ffms2/releases)

Plugins must be placed inside the `plugins64` directory inside of the VapourSynth installation directory. For users of VSRepo, plugins are installed at `C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\VaporSynth\plugins64`.

I've included some compiled plugins for both Windows and Linux users under the `bin` directory, although I might not keep them up to date. Copy them into your `plugins64` directory (see above).

## Other Features

### Previewing Clips

If you wish to preview clips before generating screenshots, use the `compare.py` file. This functionality utilizes the `view` module, and unlike most other methods, does not require `vspipe` or `vsedit` which is incredibly convenient as you can run it like a normal Python file. The OpenCV Python module is required - see [Dependencies](#dependencies) above.

If you wish to compare test encode(s) vs. the source, specify the frame range using the `--frames`/`-f` argument. This will slice the source to ensure frames match during comparison. Depending on where the video is sliced, slight adjustments might be required to ensure all video files are aligned.

You can also take screenshots in the preview window using keybindings, although they will be missing some features included with the `screenshots.py` module.

#### Keyboard and mouse controls

The preview window exposes a large set of hotkeys inherited from the upstream `view` module. The highlights below cover the controls most users rely on day-to-day:

- **Switching clips & playback**: Press the number keys `1`–`9`/`0` to select a loaded clip. Use `,` and `.` (or `<` and `>`) for single-frame stepping, `Home`/`End` to jump to the first or last frame, and the spacebar to toggle play/pause. `Q` closes the preview (or resets the current zoom/crop if one is active).【F:modules/vs_preview/view.py†L201-L220】【F:modules/vs_preview/view.py†L229-L235】
- **Zooming & cropping**: Double-click with the left mouse button or press `Z` to zoom 2× around the cursor. Click and drag to draw a crop rectangle, then confirm with `Enter`, a double-click inside the selection, or the right mouse button. `Esc` returns to the previous zoom/crop and `R` resets to the full frame. While adjusting a crop you can nudge the selected edge or the entire region with `Y`, `N`, `G`, and `J` (up/down/left/right).【F:modules/vs_preview/view.py†L205-L244】
- **Inspecting frames**: Press `I` to print RGB/YUV values for the pixel under the cursor and `P` to dump all available VapourSynth frame properties for the current frame.【F:modules/vs_preview/view.py†L221-L226】
- **Saving images & UI toggles**: `W` saves a full-resolution PNG of the current frame, while `E` writes exactly what is on screen (respecting zoom). Toggle the seek slider with `S`, switch fullscreen with `F`, and press `H` at any time to print the full hotkey list in the terminal.【F:modules/vs_preview/view.py†L227-L235】

### Tonemapping

> NOTE: Tonemapping has changed significantly since the last release of this project

For any HDR/DoVi/HDR10+ sources, the scripts now perform the full libplacebo tonemapping pipeline directly through `vs-placebo`. HDR clips are detected via their `_Transfer` and `_Primaries` frame properties, converted to RGB48, normalised for libplacebo, and then tonemapped with BT.709 / BT.1886 output using dynamic peak detection.  Each attempt records a frame property describing the chosen settings so you can audit the output later.  Should the hardware path fail the helpers loudly fall back to a plain RGB24 conversion so you never end up with a silently untonemapped result.  Recent `vs-placebo` builds remain recommended to keep pace with libplacebo's tonemapping improvements.

For properly tonemapping DoVi, additional plugins are required. See [Dependencies](#dependencies) for more information.

## Arguments

### Screenshot Notes

One or more of the following arguments are required:

- `--source`/`-s`
- `--encodes` / `-e`
- `--input_directory`/`-d`

If no source is passed and `--input_directory` is used, the script will attempt guess the source based on file size and exclude it (assuming all files are saved in the same directory). If the source is located in a different directory, it is recommended to pass the source via argument so indexing is performed correctly.

### Shared Arguments

> A \* denotes that an argument is required only if a similar argument isn't already passed (i.e., `--frames` vs `--random_frames`)

| `random_frames`    | `-r`  | Generate `count` random, sequential frames between `start` & `stop`. Input is space delimited in the form `start stop count` | <b>*</b>True |

### Compare Only

The preview resolution is used to scale dimensions for your viewing monitor, and is unrelated to the dimensions of the video files. Once a resolution is specified, it is then scaled based on the crop values to eliminate stretching.

Options for `preview_resolution`:

- 720p
- 1080p
- 1440p
- 2160p

| -------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `preview_resolution` | `-p`  | Preview window resolution to better match the monitor. Default is '1080p' | False     |

## Examples

### Compare

```bash
# Compare a source vs. an encode
~$ python3 compare.py "$HOME/Videos/MySource/Source.mkv" --encodes "$HOME/Videos/MySource/Encode1.mkv"
```

```bash
# Set view resolution to 1440p. Note this doesn't have to match the source resolution
~$ python3 compare.py "$HOME/Videos/MySource/Source.mkv" --encodes "$HOME/Videos/MySource/Encode1.mkv" \
    --preview_resolution '1440p'
```

```PowerShell
# View frames between 1000-5000. Useful for comparing source against test encodes
PS > python compare.py "$HOME\Videos\MySource\Source.mkv" --encodes "$HOME\Videos\MySource\Encode1.mkv" `
     "$HOME\Videos\MySource\Encode2.mkv" "$HOME\Videos\MySource\Encode3.mkv" --frames 1000 5000
```

### Screenshots

```PowerShell

```

## Troubleshooting

### Python Can't Find VapourSynth

If Python can't detect VapourSynth after installation, navigate to the VapourSynth installation directory and **copy** (not cut) the dynamic libraries `vapoursynth.dll`/`vapoursynth.so` and `vsscript.dll`/`vsscript.so` and paste them into either the root directory of your Python installation directory or one of the `site-packages` directories.

### Feature x Does Not Work

This is more than likely a plugin or a PATH issue. Make sure you have the latest plugins installed in the `plugins64` directory, and both VapourSynth and Python are available via system PATH.

### Python Can't Load Module 'utils.py'

This is most likely a Python path issue. To solve, set (or append to) the environment variable `PYTHONPATH` with the path of the `modules` directory inside this project.

### Error `Tonemap: Function does not take argument(s) named tone_mapping_function_s`

The helpers now intercept this error and automatically retry through awsmfunc's software tonemapping path when the installed `vs-placebo` build does not understand the newer keyword arguments. You'll still receive a warning pointing you toward VSRepo/upstream builds if you want libplacebo-powered tonemapping, but the clip continues to render. If the plugin is missing `Tonemap` entirely (or VapourSynth cannot find the module) the script will abort with a clearer message asking you to reinstall the plugin.
